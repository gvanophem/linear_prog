\begin{Exercise}[title={Modeling the Traveling Salesman Problem}]

The Traveling Salesman Problem is a famous combinatorial optimization problem where a salesman has to find the shortest tour visiting all cities from a given set $N=\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
The salesman can travel between every pair of cities $i,j \in N$, which are separated by a distance $d_{ij}$.
Find a dynamic programming model for the Traveling Salesman Problem.

\Question What information is contained in the states of the model?
